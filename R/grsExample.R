#' Filtered Mock Epigenomics Data Set
#'
#' A data set containing data that is similar in structure to that typically
#' found in epigenomics studies.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   This data set was simulated based on several key characteristics of data
#'   sets available to the package authors through collaborations in studies of
#'   differential methylation. While the motivating data sets were collected on
#'   the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) platform, the data has
#'   been reduced for convenience purposes. We emphasize that this is not real
#'   data and is not in any way suitable for scientific investigation. Please
#'   note that THIS IS NOT REAL DATA.
#' }
#'
#' @return A \code{GenomicRatiSet} containing pre-filtered CpG sites, ready to
#'         be used with the core function of the \code{methyvim} package.
